  are boring and often write long paragraphs of content and news stories. The
  modern age blogger is more technologically advanced than you could imagine.
  They are at the precipice of technology, especially those who write tech news,
  reviews and those who play games to review them. While you can still use an
  Xbox One, PS4 or PC to play games and review them, a dedicated gaming laptop
  that is sturdy and easy to carry around will come in handy. The ASUS TUF
  gaming laptop FX504 is one such product which has been built to last long with
  a sturdy base and you can type lots of content on it without straining the
  keyboard.\r

  \r

  The best part is the hardware specifications of this product which includes
  a dedicated graphics card. The Asus TUF series of products are rigid and
  durable. This laptop stands true to the name. It features a large 15.6-inch HD
  display and gaming at 1080p is much easier for most modern AAA titles. Under
  the strong hood, there is an 8th generation Intel Core i5-8300H processor
  clocked at 3.9 GHz. That’s a lot of power for not only gaming but you can also
  use Photoshop and other demanding software required for your blogging purpose.
  It has 8 GB of DDR4 RAM combined with 256 GB of M.2 SSD storage and it even
  has Wi-Fi AC for fastest internet connectivity.\r

  \r

  The dedicated card is the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050Ti which is more than
  enough for most gaming requirements and will also subsequently speed up most
  software operations. The Value edition even comes bundled with Gears of War 4
  game and the classic Age of Empires Definitive Edition. You can be a gamer or
  a tech reviewer. Either way, the laptop comes in handy to work on the go with
  the best hardware power. The laptop weighs just 5.07 lbs which are lightweight
  considering the components used in it. There are lots of connectivity ports
  including Ethernet, HDMI, multiple USB ports and headphone jack for your
  gaming/reviewing needs. The heat vents help keep the laptop cool even when
  under pressure."
